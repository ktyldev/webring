# Will's Simple Webring

This webring isn't really a webring.

I'm so good at naming things.

This is a static JSON file accessible here: https://willdotwhite.github.io/webring/data.json

All members of the community can fetch this file on demand and do whatever they like with it - traditional webring, list of people in an <aside>, interactive web game; the sky's the limit!

# Joining the webring

1. Submit a pull request to `data.json` to add yourself to the list
2. Ping me to let me know you've done it
3. Integrate it into your website somehow

# Join Criteria

I know you, or someone I trust vouches for you :D

This is not a public webring (yet) but a webring of friends and the cool stuff they do.

# Adding your site to the code

Fill in your details in the JSON list - the setup is this:

```json
{
  "name": "What name would you like to be referred to",
  "title": "Short title of your site/project",
  "description": "One line sentence that others can use to signpost your site",
  "url": "https://theactuallyonlyimportantthinginthe.list"
}
```

```css
:root {
    --color-text: #444;
    --color-accent: #ff369a;
}

.webring {
    text-align: center;
}

.webring.header {
    margin-top: 50px;
}

.webring.links {
    margin-bottom: 50px;
}

.webring.splitter {
    width: 40px;
    height: 4px;
    margin: 0 10px 3px 10px;
    background-color: var(--color-accent);
    display: inline-block;
}

a {
    text-decoration: underline 2px var(--color-accent);
    padding: 0 2px;
    color: var(--color-text);
}

a:hover {
    text-decoration: none;
    border: solid 2px var(--color-accent);
    border-radius: 4px;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    padding: 0;
}

a:visited {
    color: var(--color-accent);
}
```

The above should be enough to implement the component accurately with no dependencies, however in practice it is implemented using the [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework, which allows for scripting to run at build-time to dynamically determine the links. The Astro component can be found verbatim [here](https://sauce.wednesday.pizza/ktyl/ktyl.dev/src/components/Webring.astro), which includes some templating and JavaScript to do aforementioned generation.
